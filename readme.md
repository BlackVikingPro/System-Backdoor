# About
System-Backdoor Unleashed is a fork from **bressan3/System-Backdoor** that contains not only the traditional
TCP reverse-shell (that only supports Linux), but also fully functional reverse-shell software for multiple
different platforms. The software is neatly organized in subdirectories that explain the target OS, the lang
that the reverse-shell was written in, and the individual method of connectivity (TCP/UDP). 

# Release Date
The initial release for the Unleashed has already been launched. However, projects for other platforms are
coming soon. Subscribe for the newest bleeding-edge updates!
